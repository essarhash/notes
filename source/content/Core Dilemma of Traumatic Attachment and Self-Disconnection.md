I want to explain briefly the core dilemma of attachment trauma and how it leads to self-disconnection.

So the core dilemma of attachment trauma is that because 
**children are so biologically driven to stay connected with their caregivers**, 
like that is a essential survival need, is to stay connected and bonded with caregivers, 
children have to do that and 
**have to find a way to maintain that connection even if those caregivers are not safe for them**, right?
...Even if they are abusive or emotionally neglectful or disconnected in a range of ways.

So the core dilemma is —  
- I am forced to rely on people that I can't actually be safe with 
- and what do I need to do both in the relationship with those caregivers and within myself 
- in order to maintain that connection to the best of my ability 
- and protect myself from the elements of the relationship which are unsafe."

**Ultimately what ends up happening from that core dilemma is disconnection with self** 
- because it is not possible to maintain a full connection with yourself 
- and also maintain a full connection with people that are unsafe for you 
...and this happens in a variety of ways based on the specific context.

So like let's say you have parents that are just not able to hold space for difficult emotion, they reject you anytime that you're upset, 
- you are going to have to disconnect from your own distressing emotions in order to maintain connection with them. 
- So dissociation and emotional numbing and freezing and shutting down and overall disconnecting from your inner emotional world is going to be a survival tactic in order to maintain more connection with caregivers.

Maybe you have parents who can't tolerate certain parts of your personality or specific emotions like they can't tolerate anger or they can't tolerate you being upset with them 
- and so there's specific parts of yourself, your own personality and your own inner emotional world that you learn to disconnect from and cut off contact with in order to again maintain more connection with those caregivers.

Pure attachment happens when we are able to be fully connected with ourselves, right, with our own inner emotional world and our own authentic personalities and know that we're also going to have connection with other people, belonging and safety and connection with other people.

###### **And in attachment trauma the core dilemma is that we don't have access to both** 
and so when kids are put in a situation where they have to
###### **hang on to connection by compromising and cutting off parts of themselves**, 
that is what they will do. 

Because the drive for maintaining that connection and belonging is so strong. 
And the result of that self-disconnection, that cut off from different parts of yourself and parts of your emotions, **leads to all kinds of secondary mental health problems.**

So people come in with you know depression and anxiety and all these other things that they're struggling with but when we're looking at it through an attachment trauma lens and **we follow those threads down to the roots this is what we find inevitably with attachment trauma—**
>Oh you had to profoundly disconnect from and dissociate from parts of yourself in order to maintain more connection with caregivers and you are suffering the results of that necessary survival tactic.
